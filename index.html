	<meta name="description" content="Salmon is an AES-256 CTR encryption library with HMAC SHA-256 integrity, parallel file operations (read/write), and seekable stream support. It provides a high level, low-ceremony, consistent API for encrypting streams and files in Java and C#. Salmon is using a fast native library for Intel x86 and ARM64 that you can include in your C/C++ projects.">

			<H3>Limitations</H3>
			<pre>
* Importing files to a salmon virtual drive using different devices requires authorization by an already authorized device for each  virtual drive. The device that created the drive is by default authorized. The authorization mechanism protects against repeated access based attacks!
* Make sure that you never backup and restore the Nonce Sequencer files in your device. This is really important to prevent nonce reuse! For Windows the files are located under %LOCALAPPDATA%\\.salmon directory, for Linux and MacOS under the $HOME/.salmon directory. For Android they are under a no backup folder so they are safe.
* User Sequencer files are not secure from other apps. The sequencer file for Android is secure located in app private space but not for Android rooted devices! For Windows Salmon will notify you if it detects tampering though it is recommended for additional security that you use the Salmon Windows Service. The Windows Service protects the sequencer files under the system administrator (LocalSystem) space. For Linux and Mac make sure you do not share your account with other users!
* Integrity is not supported for filenames only for file contents.
* Maximum guaranteed file size: 2^64 bytes or limited by the backed resource (disk, memory, network).
* Maximum drive file size: 2^64 bytes
* Maximum number of drive files: 2^62 (64 bit nonces used for the filename and the file contents.
